# Ethereum

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies store coin transactions in blocks as data. However, Blockchain is oblivious to the type of stored data; multimedia files, web logs, digitized books and any other data that can be fingerprinted by a using a hash function which takes an unlimited length data and creates a fixed length (e.g., 256 bits in SHA-256) representation by using mathematical operations.

In 1997, Nick Szabo, an American computer scientist, had envisioned embedding what he called Smart Contracts as “contractual clauses in the hardware and software to make breach of contract expensive” (Szabo, 1997). Almost 20 years later Blockchain enthusiasts saw a path to implement this vision. Blockchain platforms Neo (2014), Nem (2015), Ethereum (2015) and Waves (2016) have been created to store and run software code, called Smart Contracts, on a blockchain. Benefits of storing code on a blockchain are multifold; smart contracts can be read by every blockchain network node, contracts can be executed by sending call messages to them, and all blockchain nodes will run the contract with the message to completion. These aspects mean that smart contracts allow unstoppable, unmodifiable, and publicly verifiable code execution as transactions between blockchain participants.
